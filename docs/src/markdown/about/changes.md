# Changes

## 2.4.1

- **FIX**: Remove `desktop` lib as we should not have been using it under our current license.
- **FIX**: Fix a typo which prevents displaying useful error message.

## 2.4.0

- **NEW**: Add `mermaid.js` support.
- **NEW**: Remove border from default styling of `markdown` and `github`.
- **NEW**: Exit out of `on_post_save` even quicker if no work is needed.
- **FIX**: `title` in YAML frontmatter should be handled case insensitively.

## 2.3.0

Some **breaking** changes! Please read:

- **NEW**: `pymdownx.superfences` no longer sources any settings from `markdown.extensions.codehilite` and instead uses
  `pymdownx.highlight`. No need to specify `markdown.extensions.codehilite` in the default settings.
- **NEW**: Default `pygments_css` class is now set to `highlight` which is `pymdownx.highlight`'s default. If you are
  using `pymdownx.superfences`, you use use `highlight`, if you are using `markdown.extensions.codehilite`, then you may
  want to change this to `codehilite`, or change `codehilite` to use the `highlight` class as well.
- **FIX**: Use `markdown.extensions.md_in_html` instead of `pymdownx.extrarawhtml` in the default settings as the latter
  is no longer available in the latest dependency.

Please read documentation as there have been big changes in this version which may require updates to your personal
settings.

* Do not vendor Python Markdown. Python Markdown will be acquired via the current markdown dependency.

* Python Markdown configuration changes:

    * No more defining settings as `extension(option1=a,option2=b)`. Options will be defined as a dictionary.
    * You will have to define the full extension name: `markdown.extensions.codehilite`. This will allow you to import
      any extension you want outside of Markdown Preview.
    * New line to `<br>` conversion has been dropped from GitHub emulation as GitHub no longer does this. Ref issue
      #374.

* Originally a couple pymdownx-extension extensions were ported over to this plugin to give a GitHub-ish feel to
  Markdown, these are no longer be included directly, but are included as a dependency. This will provide the latest
  versions, and also provide new extensions previously not included. Ref issue #378.

* Drop ST2 so we no longer have to provide specially crafted Python Markdown versions when we try to upgrade.

* Improve yaml front matter parsing: see issue #392.

* Better UML JavaScript injection.

* Link contributors in readme.

* Remove "magic" Pygments configuration. User will now explicitly configure Pygments CSS injection separately.

* Require explicit parser name moving forward instead of default, but provide a deprecation path for the short term.

* Fix GitHub header ID generation. GitHub only lowercases ASCII chars.

* Ensure default parser is Python Markdown, and enable auto-reload by default.

* Hopefully better documentation.

* Make flake8 compatible.

* Fix outdated links.

* Remove MathJax and UML option in favor of a more generalized solution via the pre-existing `css` option.

* Remove `embed_css_for_sublime_output` option in favor of more generalized `include_head` option.

## 1.4.3

* Fix issue where Chrome prevents live reload.

## 1.4.0

* `css` setting can now be an array and contain multiple CSS files (see settings file for more info).
* Updated GitHub style to latest.

## 1.3.0

* Now supports any markdown parser through a generalized method.  Now you can map a binary to parser name via
  `markdown_binary_map`.  Then use the parser name in `enabled_parsers` to use it.
* MultiMarkdown specific settings have been removed.  MultiMarkdown should now be configured via `markdown_binary_map`
  and `enabled_parsers`.
* Upgraded to Python Markdown 2.6.4.
* Removed internal PyYaml and Pygments.  Markdown Preview now uses Package Control dependencies to obtain PyYaml and
  Pygments.
* Update kbd CSS for GitHub.

## 1.0.3

* Try use `Markdown Extended.tmLanguage` for cheat sheet if you installed `Markdown Extended`.

## 1.0.0

* Support for ST3.
* Added Python Markdown parser.
* CSS search first in markdown file directory and the the build-in.
